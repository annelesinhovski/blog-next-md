# Blog next.js

This is a proposal of a static blog structure built using [next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) and Markdown + [processmd](https://github.com/tscanlin/processmd). This project was based on the structure proposed by @tscanlin[https://github.com/tscanlin/next-blog]

PS: As a UI foundation it uses the [react-bootstrap lib](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).
